A project for Web Technology based on HTML5.
This project utilises HTML5 as well as CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
It is a website which provides the user with comprehensive information about the English Premier League.
There are 6 main pages to this webpage followed by PHP pages as well as several backend documents as well.
The images and the webpages are organized into folders as far as possible. The main folder contains the six main pages.
The home page has the largest number of lines of code, and contains a slideshow, videos and many other aspects.
The rest of the pages implement the website aspects, such as the news, the reviews as well as the table.
The fantasy aspect of the website is not yet up and running due to lack of time and resources. Given a few more weeks, it would be fully operational.
The informations of the creators are given in the Contact Us page. 
The webpages usually have document level style sheets along with some JavaScript.
Comments have been provided wherever necessary.
